# Introduction

The next data type we are going to learn about is queues. If you've ever waited in line at the grocery store before, then you already know what a queue is! We are going to discuss what a queue really is, how we can implement them, and how can we use them to solve problems.

## What is a Queue?

Queues allow us to process information in a first-come-first-serve basis. This is know as the `First in First Out` principle or `FIFO`. Just like stacks, queues are an abstract data type so it is up to us to determine the way to implement them.
