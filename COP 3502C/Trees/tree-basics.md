# Introduction

Another useful data structure that we will discuss in COP 3502 is trees. In COP 3502 you will focus on a couple of different trees: Binary Trees, AVL Trees, Tries, and Heaps. This tutorial will be focused on Binary Trees. 

##  Defining the Tree

Before we do anything with binary trees, we first need to set up a way to represent them in C. As the word binary implies, each node in the tree can have a max of two children. To keep track of the children, each node will contain two pointers pointing to its children `left` and `right`. Lastly, each node will store some sort of data; this could be an `int`, `char`, `char*`, or another struct you create.

```c
typedef struct node{
    struct node* left;
    struct node* right;
    int val; //NOTE: Any kind of information can be stored here
}node;
```
