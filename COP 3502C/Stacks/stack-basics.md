# Applications of Stacks

When we write math equations we tend to write them like this `3 + 1 * 5`, we call this `infix notation`. How would we evaluate this expression? Well, without defining which operator should go before another, called operator precedents, there is no way to arrive at one "correct" answer.

> Consider why that is

We need a way of writing expressions that are unambiguous. Luckily, there is a way! `postfix notation` allows us to unambiguously represent different mathematical expression so that no matter who preforms them, we arrive at the same answer.
